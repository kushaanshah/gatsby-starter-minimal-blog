👋🏽 Hi, I’m Kushaan!
📈: A growth marketer and writer currently in the Bay Area, I’ve spent most of my career in tech inspired by consumer products that help people feel connected.

🗺️: On top of retention + engagement marketing by day, I’ve advised multiple early stage startups on journeys, traction funnels, social content, and more.

📝: I’ve written for years, most recently on Medium’s Better Marketing and In The Trenches publications as well a semi-weekly newsletter at Marketing Mind Meld, musing on questions I have about marketing and human behavior.

🧠: A casually optimistic systems thinker, I pride myself on bringing curiosity, foresight, energy, proven frameworks and new lens to abstract conversations.

⬅️: If you’re a founder with a marketing challenge, writer with a burning desire to share your words, or just a human looking to chat with another human, let’s connect!
